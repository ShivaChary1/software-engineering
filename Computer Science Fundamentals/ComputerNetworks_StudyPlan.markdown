# 2-Month Study Plan for Computer Networks (3 Days/Week)

This plan is designed to master core Computer Networks concepts over 2 months, studying 1 hour per day, 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), totaling ~24 hours. The schedule is structured for Notion dashboard integration, with weekly topics, learning objectives, tasks, and resources. The plan focuses on network fundamentals, protocols, and architectures (OSI model, TCP/IP, application, and network layers), with practical exercises and a final project to reinforce learning.

## Plan Overview
- **Duration**: 8 weeks, 3 days/week (Mon, Wed, Fri), 1 hour/day.
- **Total Hours**: ~24 hours (3 hours/week × 8 weeks).
- **Structure**: Each week includes theory (videos/articles), practice (quizzes, simulations), and periodic projects. Friday sessions often focus on practice or review.
- **Notion Integration**: Use a table in Notion with columns for Week, Day, Topic, Learning Objective, Tasks, Resources, and Status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Prerequisites**: Basic computer literacy; no prior networking knowledge required.
- **Goal**: By the end, you’ll understand network models (OSI, TCP/IP), key protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, IP), and apply concepts in a practical project.
