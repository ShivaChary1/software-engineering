# 2-Month Study Plan for Operating Systems (3 Days/Week)

This plan is designed to master core Operating Systems (OS) concepts over 2 months, studying 1 hour per day, 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), totaling ~24 hours. The schedule is structured for Notion dashboard integration, with weekly topics, learning objectives, tasks, and resources. The plan focuses on OS fundamentals (processes, threads, memory management, file systems, synchronization) with practical exercises and a final project to reinforce learning.

## Plan Overview
- **Duration**: 8 weeks, 3 days/week (Mon, Wed, Fri), 1 hour/day.
- **Total Hours**: ~24 hours (3 hours/week × 8 weeks).
- **Structure**: Each week includes theory (videos/articles), practice (quizzes, simulations, or coding), and periodic projects. Friday sessions often focus on practice or review.
- **Notion Integration**: Use a table in Notion with columns for Week, Day, Topic, Learning Objective, Tasks, Resources, and Status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Prerequisites**: Basic computer literacy; familiarity with a programming language (e.g., C or Python) is helpful but not required.
- **Goal**: By the end, you’ll understand OS components, process management, memory management, file systems, and synchronization, and apply them in a practical project.
