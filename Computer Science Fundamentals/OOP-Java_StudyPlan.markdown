# 2-Month Study Plan for OOP in Java (3 Days/Week)

This plan is designed to master Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java over 2 months, studying 2 hours per day, 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), totaling ~48 hours. The schedule is structured for Notion dashboard integration, with weekly topics, learning objectives, tasks, and resources. The plan covers core OOP concepts, essential advanced topics, and practical projects, condensed to fit the reduced study time.

## Plan Overview
- **Duration**: 8 weeks, 3 days/week (Mon, Wed, Fri), 2 hours/day.
- **Total Hours**: ~48 hours (6 hours/week Ã— 8 weeks).
- **Structure**: Each week includes theory (videos/books), practice (coding exercises), and mini-projects. Some weeks use a third day for review or project work.
- **Notion Integration**: Use a table in Notion with columns for Week, Day, Topic, Learning Objective, Tasks, Resources, and Status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Prerequisites**: Basic Java knowledge (variables, data types, loops, conditionals, methods).
- **Goal**: Gain proficiency in OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction) and apply them in Java projects.
